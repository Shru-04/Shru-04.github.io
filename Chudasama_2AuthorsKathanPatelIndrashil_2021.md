## Abstract
The main aim of writing this to ==provide information regarding the threats that are faced by the countries around the world== in the cyberspace. In today’s world, ==almost every device runs on internet== and are a good chance of being hacked. In today’s, age every country in linked to each other through cyber space. Today there are many new criminal activities, ==which are done in the cyberspace where cyber criminals commits cyber-crime== with irrespective of the geographical location. Nowadays the cyber-crimes are mostly done to get sensitive information or financial-driven acts. Today there are many cyber acts which helps ==one to fight against cyber-crimes==. There many international cooperation’s between countries to fight against the cyber-crimes where they have seminars, joint workshops and many more things.

### INTRODUCTION
Cyberspace the term was first given by William Gibson in one of his short stories “Burning.
The treat of cyberspace has grown and to keep it secure it requires coordinated efforts from the central, state and local government.
With increase in the use of internet cyberspace has grown at global level where everybody is connected to each other through routers, cables, switches.
In today’s world, mostly everything uses internet to work and today internet has created a social sphere, which is connected to our everyday life.
As everybody is using internet in their daily life, there are subnational groups and government organizations who uses cyberspace for country’s development in various ways.
We are twenty years in 21st century the chance of cyberwar has increased, as.
Today many countries lack in a good cyber security and through which they can be a good target [^1], [^2]

### Patel and Chudasama
THREATS AND ASSESSMENT OF VULNERABILITIES In today’s world every day we get news of hackers of hacking into systems and damage, make changes into the targets sensitive information, web pages, or just stops the user to access their device.
There are many more ways in which hackers may try and attack systems of a power plant or of stock market which may cause havoc in the country.
To avoid such scenarios a nation or a organization must have a good security for their systems [^3], [^4].
Network Readiness Index (NRI) rank–The NRI works on how the countries around the world adopt and work on the technology in terms of people, government
These criteria helps nations to identify how they are combating cyber threats risks at a national level.
In today’s world the economic strength of a nation cannot be ignored as private sector provides economic strength to the nation and its security cannot be taken [^5]

### United States
Private sector is an important aspect for a country and to create a security domain for this sector is a challenge.
It is said that there are changes required in India’s cyber security architecture that it’s still likely that government will use policy document [^8].
Cooperation to Safeguard Shared Information Infrastructure The Indian and the US government have come together to address national security issues as the dependency on network information system has involved.
It was group who focused on to cooperate on policy, procedural and the technical issues faced by both the nations in cyber security.
For India to promote its concern at international level in cyber security it formed a cooperation called CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) which now is full member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Team), APCERT and a global partner of APWG (Anti Phishing Working Group) [^9].
There should be understanding between all the agencies that are involved in fighting against cyber-crime [^9]

### Findings
In 2009, The Symantec conducted a survey of Security and Storage of India in which India registered a increase of 12% in wicked web activities from the AsiaPacific/Japan region.
By this India was marked third position in Asia-Pacific region where there were increases of 250% in bot-infected systems

### CONCLUSION
I have discussed some of the threats that may affect a national security.
The. Cyberspace is platform for showing your innovations and prosperity and a means through which we can improve welfare around the globe.
Due to its broad reach of loose and light digital infrastructure it poses a great threat to nations, private enterprise and individuals.
Cyberspace is huge and there are many problems we may face.
In an event of an attack, efforts should be made to identify the threat and recover as soon as possible.
Nowadays as there are new technologies growing every day the possibility to cyber warfare should be taken seriously as threat of a nuclear missile?.
Nowadays the dependency and the use of the computer have increased that makes any nation a vulnerable for cyber-attack.
Today we cannot be surprised of a cyber-attack because it may happen anytime and to anyone


## Study subjects

### 8 members
- The G-Force was founded in 1998 May after the Indians conducted nuclear tests. ==It is a Lahore based group and has eight members in it==. Earlier it used to target Indian sites but after the 9/11, attacks they have started attacking US based sites

## Findings
- In 2009, The Symantec (now known as NortonLifeLock) conducted a survey of Security and Storage of India in which India registered a increase of 12% in wicked web activities from the AsiaPacific/Japan region
- By this India was marked third position in Asia-Pacific region where there were increases of 250% in bot-infected systems

## Contributions
- In this paper, I have discussed some of the threats that may affect a national security. The<br/><br/>Cyberspace is platform for showing your innovations and prosperity and a means through which we can improve welfare around the globe. But due to its broad reach of loose and light digital infrastructure it poses a great threat to nations, private enterprise and individuals. The government should take the responsibility of addressing the people of the nation of the potential vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>We should recognize that in today’s world cyber security is the most important national security we have today. Cyberspace is huge and there are many problems we may face. The digital infrastructure of the nation must be treated as the national asset and it should be protected. In an event of an attack, efforts should be made to identify the threat and recover as soon as possible. Nowadays as there are new technologies growing every day the possibility to cyber warfare should be taken seriously as threat of a nuclear missile?
