## Synopsis

### Introduction
We are living in an Information age where data is oxygen. This information age rotates in the arms of a virtually created space which is known as Cyberspace.
Though cyberspace has proved to be very advantageous for human development as it has abridged the gaps between people living on the entire earth.
It has facilitated economic activities, Public infrastructure development, defence and critical infrastructure.
Illegal activities in cyberspace has posed serious threats to national security and various developed as well as developing countries like India are coming up with cybersecurity strategies to cope up with this serious situation
This project discusses about theoretical aspects of cyberspace as to what constitutes cyberspace, what are its characteristics, it talks about various types of cyber attacks and strategies therein and stakeholders to counter and control illegal acts on cyberspace

### Objectives
Scope Of The Study<br/><br/>To study about Cyber space and its constituting elements.<br/><br/>To analyse various types of cyber attacks and the ways in which they are carried out<br/><br/>To study as to how cyber attacks are threat to national security<br/><br/>To study efforts taken up government and authorities to deal with cyberspace chaos<br/><br/>This study is an holistic analysis to cyberspace, cyber attacks, national security issues related to cyber space and various strategies formulated to counter cyberspace issues.
To study about Cyber space and its constituting elements.
To analyse various types of cyber attacks and the ways in which they are carried out.
To study as to how cyber attacks are threat to national security.
To study efforts taken up government and authorities to deal with cyberspace chaos.
This study is an holistic analysis to cyberspace, cyber attacks, national security issues related to cyber space and various strategies formulated to counter cyberspace issues

### Methods
While researching doctrinal method of research is used and the material for analysis is collected primarily internet sources like various articles, reports, strategies and government and other websites.<br/><br/>Research Questions<br/><br/>What is Cyberspace?<br/><br/>What are constituting elements of cyberspace?<br/><br/>What are Cyber attacks and how they are carried?<br/><br/>What are national security issues in cyberspace?<br/><br/>What is Indian attitude towards national security in Cyberspace?<br/><br/>What is Cyber security?.
While researching doctrinal method of research is used and the material for analysis is collected primarily internet sources like various articles, reports, strategies and government and other websites.
What are Cyber attacks and how they are carried?.
What are national security issues in cyberspace?.
What is Indian attitude towards national security in Cyberspace?

### Findings
According to national security advisor Mr Ajit doval during Corona pandemic the incidents of Cyber attacks has increased by 5000% looking at all these consistently increasing threats the Government of India under National Security Council secretariat has formulated National cybersecurity strategy which aims to strengthen cyber security by increasing cyber awareness and regular robust audits

### Conclusion
We are all living in the digital era.
All our daily activities either partially or totally depend on digital devices or Internet.
Every Organization whether it is government or non-government and individuals rely on the usage of computer networks, systems and related technologies.
Most of our daily routines, including both personal and professional activities, depend on digital devices connected through public and private networks and the Internet.
These are the major questions that most of us raise when we think about the way we use Internet and other resources for communication.
Cyber Space is the virtual space that connects all of us and enables the information exchange, necessary to support interactions in the digital era.
Cyberspace is very much vulnerable to attack and it can pose various security threats to national security

## Findings
- According to national security advisor Mr Ajit doval during Corona pandemic the incidents of Cyber attacks has increased by 5000% looking at all these consistently increasing threats the Government of India under National Security Council secretariat has formulated National cybersecurity strategy which aims to strengthen cyber security by increasing cyber awareness and regular robust audits

## Contributions
- We are all living in the digital era. All our daily activities either partially or totally depend on digital devices or Internet. Every Organization whether it is government or non-government and individuals rely on the usage of computer networks, systems and related technologies. Most of our daily routines, including both personal and professional activities, depend on digital devices connected through public and private networks and the Internet.<br/><br/>Where do we operate, and which connects us? These are the major questions that most of us raise when we think about the way we use Internet and other resources for communication. The answer is: Cyber Space. Cyber Space is the virtual space that connects all of us and enables the information exchange, necessary to support interactions in the digital era. But cyberspace is very much vulnerable to attack and it can pose various security threats to national security.

## Limitations
- Or Research GAPS There is a plenty of material is available in order to understand Cyberspace and Cybersecurity issues at global level but in Indian context there is a lack of holistic analysis as to what are the main problems related to Cyberspace in India context, because in India number of internet users are high and knowledge about cyber issues is pretty much less.<br/><br/>Also when we analyse the issue of Cyber attacks there are lot of technicalities involved which are difficult to understand that's why some issues and topics are just touched upon and not discussed in detail as it also enhances the bulkiness of the project.
